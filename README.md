<br>Automate and relate multiple processes programmatically.

## Description

**arpxjs** enables Node programs to automate, schedule, and parallelize processes relative to each other based on a local YAML profile by exposing a function which binds to the **arpx** utility. See [**arpx**](https://github.com/jaredgorski/arpx) for details about the utility itself.

Invoking the exported `arpxjs()` function, passing a filepath to a valid PROFILE, and specifying an array of PROCESSES to run from the profile will execute the given PROCESSES, according to the PROFILE, in the current runtime.

## Installation
```js
$ npm install arpxjs
```

## Usage
**arpx.yaml**
```yaml
processes:
  - name: loop1
    command: |
      for i in {1..5}
      do
        sleep 1
        echo "Loop1 $i"
      done
    blocking: true
  - name: loop3
    command: |
      for i in {1..5}
      do
        sleep 1
        echo "Loop3 $i"
      done

monitors:
  - process: loop1
    condition: '[[ "$LOG_LINE" =~ "Loop1 5" ]]'
    actions:
      - loop2

actions:
  - name: loop2
    command: |
      for i in {1..3}
      do
        sleep 1
        echo "Loop2 $i"
      done
      exit
```

**index.js**
```js
const {arpxjs} = require('arpxjs');

console.log('before');
arpxjs('./arpx.yaml', ['loop1', 'loop3']);
console.log('after');
```

```shell
$ node index.js
```
